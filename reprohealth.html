                            UNFPA works to ensure sexual and reproductive health and rights remain at the very center of development. The International Conference on Population and Development draws a clear connection between reproductive health, human rights and sustainable development.

                        <li>
                            When sexual and reproductive health needs are not met, individuals are deprived of the right to make crucial choices about their own bodies and futures, with a cascading impact on their families’ welfare and future generations.

                        <li>
                            Because women bear children, and also often bear the responsibility for nurturing them, sexual and reproductive health and rights issues cannot be separated from gender equality. Cumulatively, the denial of these rights exacerbates poverty and gender inequality.

                            Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.

It upholds the right to make free and informed decisions, respects the dignity of women, and ensures the health of mothers and children. The RH Law also mandates the integration of age-appropriate reproductive health education in schools.

                        Despite legal provisions and policies, there are challenges in implementing reproductive health and family planning programs in the Philippines. Some sectors, including certain religious groups, oppose certain aspects of the RH Law, particularly those related to contraception and sex education in schools. This opposition has led to delays and limitations in fully implementing the law.

                        Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society groups play a vital role in advocating for reproductive health and family planning rights in the Philippines. They provide services and support to marginalized communities and advocate for policy reforms to improve access to reproductive health services.
